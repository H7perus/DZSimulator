### TODO list for the web port of DZSimulator

- Figure out a good way of grabbing the mouse
- Add more build info
    - MAGNUM_TARGET_WEBGL
    - [Emscripten version](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/17883)
    - OpenGL version?
    - pthreads multithreading support: __EMSCRIPTEN_PTHREADS__
    - Why is CORRADE_TARGET_32BIT defined?
- License text can't be copied to clipboard
- Replace portable-file-dialogs calls with something else in web builds
    - E.g. glidability shader init error msg
- Figure out changing screen size and entering fullscreen
- Does GSI or netconport work with CS from the web?
    - Use [Emscripten socket support](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/networking.html)?
    - Implement GSI with Asio to get rid of cpp-httplib in web builds?
    - If neither GSI or netconport work, get rid of cpp-httplib and Asio in web builds
    - Add note in LICENSES-THIRD-PARTY.txt that some libraries are not used in web builds?
- Get rid of include directories from unused libraries in CMakeLists.txt
- Test VSync and FPS settings. Useless in web builds?
- Test DPI scaling in the web
- Check out Emscripten ports for zlib/bzip2 and Bullet!
- Add an Emscripten Debug build option? What are the benefits? Faster build times?
    - https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/platforms-html5.html#platforms-html5-code-size
- Refactor BUILDING.md
- Different browsers must be tested
- Check out [Emscripten speed and memory profiling](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/Debugging.html#profiling)
- Test if hardware acceleration is disabled in browser and tell user about it
- Is [this](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/file-system-access/) a way to read from a user's CSGO installation? Can this grant access to a directory or just single files?
